    "zmentures_intro": "is an upgraded version of the original game, dating back to the times of Ledins, which has undergone many changes throughout its history. In its new form, it contains 12 levels that are very easy at the beginning, but the difficulty quickly increases, reaching its peak at level 6. The entire game is structured through a story, the main thread of which is the Dragon's return home after escaping from NASA's experimental laboratory! The game can be quite a challenge for first-time players, as it contains a lot of unexpected events, many deaths, but hopefully also a lot of fun. Based on player feedback, several aids have been implemented today. We're talking about automatic progress saving at the beginning of each level, as well as checkpoints implemented within the game. On the easy level, they appear automatically, while on the hard level, they need to be unlocked (HINT: find the secret level). The game also includes an expansion called Zmentures++, which takes you through the city and adds the cherry on top of the cake, further expanding the story. Have lots of joy and patience while playing.",

    "crackelov_intro": "The game was inspired by games like Subway Surfers or Zombie Tsunami. With the game, I primarily wanted to figure out how to create games that follow the endless principle.

    "my_intro": "The project began in high school, initially under the name 'CREATING A 2D GAME IN HTML USING CSS AND JAVASCRIPT', with the aim of getting a good grade for graduation. In 2022, the game received its first update, where I wanted to test my new programming skills. The purpose of the gameâ€™s renovation, which finally got its own name, wasn't for it to be played by everyone in the countryside, because let's be honest, how many players actually reached the goal or tried all the games? No, the purpose was for the game to get the form it deserved. <br> The project took over 300 hours, and the game became very complex, which I believe is evident if you have played or will play it. There were many challenges during programming, but in the end, everything was successfully resolved - well, almost everything. The renovation includes new levels of the original game, 4 new games, a revamped UI, new gameplay concepts, and is ideal for many hours of fun. It evolved from a speed running game into a gaming platform. I never imagined that the project would turn into a Diploma Thesis, but I am glad it did, as it allowed the game to be truly perfected. I must admit that I am very satisfied with the final form of Zmejelov. It's that feeling when you imagine something in your head, and then when you execute it, itâ€™s even 10 times better. That is Zmejelov for me. As some have mentioned, the game reflects a part of me. I sincerely hope you enjoy playing it and that it brightens your day. Have fun and happy gaming, and don't forget to 'keep on zmejeloving'! <br> <br> The greatest thanks go to my brain, which contributed all the ideas and then helped implement them. Special thanks also to everyone who passively and actively inspired and helped in the design of the project, with special thanks to Gaja, who always gladly tested and listened to my ideas. <br> <br> -the biggest zmejelover<br> <br>",
